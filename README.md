# WeatherLyfeWeb
Javascript version of an iOS/Android app I made live. Here I use the Fetch API to make requests to the Open Weather Service.
However, you will need an api key from the site to make this work as I have not included the key in this project. There is a variable here for holding the key called APP_ID in the app.js file.

This app is also repsonsive for tablets and mobile devices as well! :)

The iOS/Swift Version is live at:
